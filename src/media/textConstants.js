    "LAUNCH WEEKS Blizzard launches new content on Thursdays at 6 PM. On the first week of every tier, we will be raiding on launch day and entering the raid as soon as possible (aiming for 6 PM, assuming servers are working!) We will always have a head's up from Blizzard for this, so we'll be sure to communicate specific dates as soon as we can to allow you ample time to make schedule changes!",
  scheduleContent2: "PROGRESSION Tue/Wed/Mon 7:30-10:30 PM EST (server time)",
  scheduleContent3:
    "Our standard scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday from 7:30-10:30 EST (server time). During progression, we will be adding Monday from 7:30-10:30 EST to this schedule. Raiders will be given as much notice as possible to accommodate scheduling Monday raid nights.",
  scheduleContent4:
    "We have found that it is best to “front-load” progression by adding hours early in the tier when people are most excited (and stockpiled) for the content. Within a few weeks, the content is cleared within 2 nights (or, in most cases, 1 night!)",
  scheduleContent5:
    "Note: Blizzard has shown a preference for releasing raids on Thursdays. To minimize impact on progression, the first raid week of each tier may be shifted to Thurs/Fri/Sat, with the goal being to enter the raid as early as possible on the Thursday of launch for the sake of securing realm rankings. We will always give raiders as much notice as possible when this occurs!",

    "Alt Runs/Splits: These will always be organized around interest and attendance. We know the interest is there, but it will be hard to tell how feasible organized splits will be until we get to Wrath! Additional split run info in the Expectations section!) ",
  expectationContent1:
    "We require everyone to be able to carry their own weight and be a contributing member of the raid team. This includes everything from having (and using) a functioning microphone, to playing your class well, to treating fellow raiders with respect, and everything in between. Members are expected to have their BiS crafted gear early during each phase. The guild will facilitate or assist whenever possible, but this is ultimately your responsibility. Raiders must have all gear enchanted, gemmed, and be using full BiS consumes during all current content.",
  expectationContent2:
    "Professions: The overwhelming majority of raiders have expressed interest in taking progression raiding and speedruns more seriously in Wrath Classic. To facilitate this, we will very likely be requiring raiders' main characters to have engineering trained and leveled for raid. NOTE: We are awaiting updates from Blizzard to know whether Engineering will be nerfed or not. Prepare and expect to level Engineering, but feel free to wait until confirmation is given.",
  expectationContent3:
    "During Phase 1 of Wrath, we are asking raiders to strive to have an alt ready to raid 4-6 weeks after launch. Our intentions are organizing a raid filled with our alts that we would be interested in swapping out in the main raid when needed for compositional reasons, or for speed running to bring our best-geared characters. These will never be required, and are mostly going to exist to give us a chance to play at a high level on these alts and, hinging on luck, maybe get better gear than your main and use that character when we are going for speed or pushing progression in the next tier.",
  progressionContent1:
    "We will be practicing content ahead of time either through a guild-ran private server, PTR, or VoD-watching parties in order to ensure content goes down as soon as possible. Raiders are expected to be knowledgeable and prepared for the next phase with research on gear and strategies. This means keeping up to date on your class Discord and top content creators for your class and spec. We will always be raiding as soon as the content is released, even if it does not line up with our current raid times. When content is released on PTR, we will be having mandatory PTR raids to learn the fights, make WeakAuras, and be as prepared as possible. Doing these things will help us reach 1-night clears much more quickly, and will result in fewer hours being spent raiding each phase.",
  progressionContent2:
    "Playing risky, focusing on DPS, and dying due to your own controllable mistakes will not be tolerated, ESPECIALLY during progression, where the focus is on smoothness and consistency. We maintain the attitude that the group comes first. Personal parses feel good, but being in a guild with a reputation for being good, and being a core member of that group feels better. Your personal parses take a back seat at times for the good of the group, and none of us want to enjoy our hobby with our friends and hear people complain about having to perform a mechanic and ruining their parse.",
  progressionContent3:
    "Raiders may be asked to swap in and out, or even swap to different characters during progression. We will have some community accounts with key classes leveled, and there may be times where people are asked to play their alts or a community character in order to create a more ideal comp for progression.",
  performanceContent1:
    "<Focus Up> Raid spots will be competitive in Wrath Classic. Everyone is expected to parse in the top 25% of their class, with consideration being given to those in more supportive or utility roles. (Note this is subject to change as we see fit) While parsing is an important metric, it is not the only aspect of play considered, and doing mechanics properly > parsing, ALWAYS. For example, here are some red flags: pulling aggro, focusing the wrong target, disruptive play/comms, slowing down the raid (frequent afk’s, not running back after a wipe, slow buffing), not being prepared, not knowing the fights or mechanics ahead of time, frequent deaths, selfish play, etc.",
  trialsContent1:
    "(2 weeks). The trial period may be extended if they're not yet meeting the requirements, or if we are still looking for more data/info. All trials (and raiders) have the option and are encouraged to request reviews after each raid to tell them our thoughts on performance/tactics and what we'd like to see improved. If we see attempts to improve, we are more likely to show leniency!",
  attendanceContent1:
    "90%+ attendance is expected. If your attendance starts to become a problem, you'll be talked to directly to see if a solution can be found. Please let us know as far ahead of time as possible of any potential lateness/absence. *NOTE: Attendance is especially important during early weeks of progression. During farm content, we are open to offering more leniency, especially as people work with their families to \"bank\" time for progression weeks in the next tier. If attendance is a consistent issue, it doesn't at all mean you have to leave <Focus Up>. It is crucial that we establish a healthy bench and community for alt and split runs. All <Focus Up> members are valued and appreciated, and we would love to work with you to find a way to keep you in our community!",
  lootContent1:
    "We'll be using That's My BiS to help keep track of our loot system. Our loot council determines loot priorities based on raider-created wishlists, and the gearing demands of the raid content. These lists are created through public discussion and are on display for feedback and criticism before the release of the new raid tier. As we progress through a tier, we may deviate from these priority systems to more efficiently distribute loot. Again, we operate with a group > individual philosophy.",
  lootContent2:
    "As we near the release of a new phase, we may become more heavy-handed in our loot distribution decisions based on theorycrafting. Raiders are expected to understand (and, ideally, support) this, and to not throw temper tantrums about loot.",
