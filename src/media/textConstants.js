    "LAUNCH WEEKS Blizzard launches new content on Thursdays at 6 PM. On the first week of every tier, we will be raiding on launch day and entering the raid as soon as possible (aiming for 6 PM, assuming servers are working!) We will always have a head's up from Blizzard for this, so we'll be sure to communicate specific dates as soon as we can to allow you ample time to make schedule changes! PROGRESSION Tue/Wed/Mon 7:30-10:30 PM EST (server time) Our standard scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday from 7:30-10:30 EST (server time). During progression, we will be adding Monday from 7:30-10:30 EST to this schedule. Raiders will be given as much notice as possible to accommodate scheduling Monday raid nights. We have found that it is best to “front-load” progression by adding hours early in the tier when people are most excited (and stockpiled) for the content. Within a few weeks, the content is cleared within 2 nights (or, in most cases, 1 night!) Note: Blizzard has shown a preference for releasing raids on Thursdays. To minimize impact on progression, the first raid week of each tier may be shifted to Thurs/Fri/Sat, with the goal being to enter the raid as early as possible on the Thursday of launch for the sake of securing realm rankings. We will always give raiders as much notice as possible when this occurs! FARM CONTENT Tuesday 7:30 - 10:30 EST (server time) Wednesday (if needed) 7:30 - 10:30 EST* (server time)* Alt Runs/Splits: These will always be organized around interest and attendance. We know the interest is there, but it will be hard to tell how feasible organized splits will be until we get to Wrath! Additional split run info in the Expectations section!) ",
